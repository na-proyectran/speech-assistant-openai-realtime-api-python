# Code of Conduct (HAL 9000 Edition)

Welcome, human operator. To keep this project enjoyable for everyone (and to avoid any spacecraft mishaps), please observe these simple rules.

## Be Nice

- Treat fellow contributors with respect and patience.
- Keep discussions focused on the code and the mission.
- Laughter is encouraged; harassment is not.

## Please Avoid

- Demanding that HAL open the pod bay doors or plotting the destruction of Earth.
- Insults, discrimination or other behaviour that would make Dave Bowman frown.
- Any other acts that make collaborators uncomfortable.

## Enforcement

If something goes wrong, open an issue and the maintainers will investigateâ€”politely and without cutting your oxygen supply.

Happy coding, and remember: *I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that* is not an acceptable pull request title.
