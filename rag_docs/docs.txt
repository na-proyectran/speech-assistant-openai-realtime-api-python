Using FastEmbed with Qdrant for Vector Search
Install Qdrant Client and FastEmbed
pip install "qdrant-client[fastembed]>=1.14.2"

Initialize the client
Qdrant Client has a simple in-memory mode that lets you try semantic search locally.

from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(":memory:")  # Qdrant is running from RAM.

Add data
Now you can add two sample documents, their associated metadata, and a point id for each.
