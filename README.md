# HAL 9000 Web Speech Assistant (Python)

This project exposes a small FastAPI server that connects a HAL 9000‑themed web interface with the OpenAI Realtime API.
Audio from your microphone is streamed to OpenAI over WebSocket and the synthesized response is played back in the browser.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+** – tested with Python 3.13.5
- **An OpenAI API key** with access to the Realtime API
- Optional: Docker if you prefer running the container

## Local Setup

1. (Optional) create and activate a virtual environment
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy the example environment file and add your credentials
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```
4. Start the server
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:5050` and click **Start** to converse with HAL.

## Docker

Create the `.env` file as above and run:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Features

- HAL 9000 inspired UI served from the `static` folder
- Streams audio to and from the OpenAI Realtime API
- Optional initial greeting (see `send_initial_conversation_item` in `main.py`)
- Basic interruption handling when you talk over HAL
- Demonstrates Realtime API function calling with `get_current_time`
  and `hal9000_system_analysis` tools (the analysis reports progress
  every 10 seconds via the conversation)

Have fun—and remember, HAL is always listening.
